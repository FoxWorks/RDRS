Status
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a pre-release repository. It's not yet fully ready for use in real applications,
but can be already used for familiarization.

Information
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RDRS is an open-source realtime digital radio physics and simulation library. It
can be used for modelling behavior of the digital radio link in realtime and modelling
the effects of radio transmission on the data.


Target Use
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RDRS requires a 64-bit OS for a full support for high-speed long-range radio
communication and enough free space on hard drive for storing the sent data.

If long-range radio support is not required, the 32-bit version will suffice.
The following platforms are supported:
 - Windows (32-bit and 64-bit)
 - Linux (32-bit and 64-bit)
